# XCatch
### EfficiÃ«nt yet effective plugin to catch X-rayers for Minecraft 1.13-1.18.
XCatch analizes how a player is mining by looking it how many turns it makes and how many rare ores it finds in a small period of time.

## Why use this over other plugins
- Plugins that hide ores (like Orebfuscator) are generally very CPU intensive, while XCatch is not and those plugins can be bypassed if the player knows the seed, which can be easily obtained with a seedcracker mod, while XCatch cannot be easily bypassed.
- Plugins that announce when a player has mined a lot of ores (like OreAnnouncer) have way more false flags when players are just lucky or when they find a big ore vein
